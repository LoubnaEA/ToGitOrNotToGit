Act1 scene 5

Romeo:
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
As a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.


Act2 scene 2

Romeo:
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.


Act5 scene 3

Romeo:
Here’s to my love! [Drinks] O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. [Falls]

Juliet:
O happy dagger!
[Snatching ROMEO’s dagger]
This is thy sheath; there rust, and let me die.
[She falls on ROMEO’s body]
