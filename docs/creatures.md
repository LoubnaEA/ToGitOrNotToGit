# *The Creatures*  

> **Part II - The Jacobean & Elizabethan Edge**  
> Focus : Characters and archetypes, from protagonists to spectral figures, embodying creators’ narrative intentions.  

### ✨ Characters of the English Renaissance Stage

From **1558** to **1642**, the English stage teemed with life, from noble heroes and star-crossed lovers to scheming villains and spectral apparitions.  
These **creatures** are the living embodiments of the playwrights’ moral, political and psychological preoccupations.  

The `creatures.md` dataset constitutes the dramatic counterpart to `creators.md`, focusing on the characters that populate Renaissance drama.  
Each record represents a character entity, structured to balance literary nuance with analytical usability. Each character is catalogued with metadata capturing traits, roles, narrative functions and bridging **literary analysis** with **data exploration**.  
  
- **Number of authors :** 20 core dramatists `creators.md`
- **Estimated total characters :** ~ 210
- **Unit of analysis :** One *creature* (character) per row 
- **Plays covered :** ~ 50-60
- **Characters per play :** 5-15 (up to 20+ in major works)
- **Dataset purpose :** Serve as a pivot between **authors** and **stage personas**, enabling quantitative and qualitative analyses of character, plot, and theatrical archetypes
- **Relational scope :** linked by `Creator_ID`, `Play_ID`, `Character_ID`  

Each creature can thus be traced to its author, play and network of symbolic or emotional relations.

The dataset is designed for both **qualitative interpretation** and **quantitative exploration**.  
A flexible framework adaptable to database, graph, visualization models.

### ✨ Strategy for Dataset Population  

1. **Tiered Author Approach**   
   * **Tier A** 🔴 (Primary authors, major influence) : Jonson, Marlowe, Shakespeare, etc.   
     → Most characters (~ 170-180) come from these authors.  
   * **Tier B** 🟠 (Supporting authors, smaller but significant corpus) : Beaumont, Fletcher, Ford, etc.    
     → ~ 30–40 characters.  
   * **Tier C** 🟡 (Minor or peripheral authors) : Only key characters for coverage (~ 5-10).

2. **Character Selection**   
   * Prioritized **central and semi-central characters** : Protagonist, Villain, Tragic Hero, Revenger.
   * Added **symbolic, marginal and spectral figures** to capture thematic breadth.
   * Ensured coverage of **diverse archetypes** and **moral alignments**.

3. **Data Enrichment**  
   * **Quantitative attributes :** `speech_length`, `role_importance`, `number_of_characters_in_play`  
   * **Qualitative attributes :** `dominant_traits`, `archetype`, `moral_alignment`, `visual_motifs`  
   * **Contextual attributes :** `interacts_with`, `costume_props`, `introduction_scene`, `gender_performance`  

4. **Data Consistency & Validation**  
   * Normalized **categorical columns** (e.g., `gender`, `social_status`, `dramatic_function`).
   * Checked **relational integrity** (`Author_ID` → `Play_ID` → `Character_ID`).
   * Sorted alphabetically and curated manually to remove duplicates, fill missing metadata, ensure consistent formatting.

5. **Analytical Flexibility**  
The dataset is designed to allow both **EDA**, **graph/network analysis** and **visualizations** (e.g., character networks, archetype distributions, gender representation).

### ✨ QA Checklist & EDA for Dataset Integrity
 
The **QA checklist** ensures the reliability of the `creatures.md` dataset by providing a framework for quantitative and qualitative verification, covering individual character entries, relational links, categorical attributes.

#### Purpose
* Guarantee **structural consistency** : all core fields present and properly typed.
* Ensure **narrative and analytical correctness** : roles, archetypes, moral alignment, interactions.
* Enable **traceability** : character ↔ play ↔ author alignment.
* Support reproducible exploratory analysis and visualization.

#### Verification Methods
✅ **Automated / EDA checks**
   * Completeness of mandatory columns : `character`, `author`, `play`, `dramatic_function`, etc.
   * Data types and categorical normalization (`gender`, `social_status`, `archetype`)
   * Distribution checks : speech length, role importance, number of characters per play.
   * Basic relational integrity : counts per author, per play, cross-checks for duplicates.

✅ **Manual / Contextual checks**
   * Narrative consistency : verifying character archetypes, moral alignment, dramatic function.
   * Interactions : validation of `interacts_with` relationships.
   * Special or symbolic entities : ensuring correct classification of marginal, spectral or metaphysical characters.
   * Coverage of key characters per play and per author, especially for Tier A authors (e.g., Shakespeare).

#### Implementation Notes
* The QA checklist is maintained in `data/processed/QA_checklist.md`  
* Each checklist item indicates whether it is **automatically verifiable via scripts/EDA** or **requires manual review**.
* For initial population, starting with **Shakespeare (~ 18-20 characters)** allows iterative validation before scaling to the full dataset.

### ✨ Creators by Tier

**Tier A 🔴 Core Canon** (4 authors) : Ben **Jonson**, Christopher **Marlowe**, John **Webster**, William **Shakespeare**         
- Deep analyses, rich dataset, major references.       
- These authors represent the most influential voices of the English Renaissance stage, with iconic characters and maximal analytical impact.

**Tier B 🟠 Structuring Pillars** (6 authors) : Francis **Beaumont**, John **Fletcher**, John **Ford**, Thomas **Kyd**, Philip **Massinger**, Thomas **Middleton**    
- Strong depth, solid comparisons, less exhaustive.      
- Key genres such as revenge, tragicomedy and moral tragedy ; bridging the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods.   

**Tier C 🟡 Context & Ecosystem** (10 authors) : George **Chapman**, Thomas **Dekker**, Thomas **Heywood**, Robert **Greene**, John **Lyly**, Thomas **Nashe**, John **Marston**, George **Peele**, James **Shirley**, William **Rowley**  
- Minimal coverage, network role, without overloading.     
- Important but heterogeneous voices, often collaborative or fragmentary, providing context and network connections.

### ✨ Columns
