# *The Creatures*  

> **Part II - The Jacobean & Elizabethan Edge**  
> Focus : Characters and archetypes, from protagonists to spectral figures, embodying creators’ narrative intentions.  

### ✨ Characters of the English Renaissance Stage

From **1558** to **1642**, the English stage teemed with life, from noble heroes and star-crossed lovers to scheming villains and spectral apparitions.  
These **creatures** are the living embodiments of the playwrights’ moral, political and psychological preoccupations.  

The `creatures.md` dataset constitutes the dramatic counterpart to `creators.md`, focusing on the characters that populate Renaissance drama.  
Each record represents a character entity, structured to balance literary nuance with analytical usability. Each character is catalogued with metadata capturing traits, roles, narrative functions and bridging **literary analysis** with **data exploration**.  
  
- **Number of authors :** 20 core dramatists `creators.md`
- **Estimated total characters :** ~130–150
- **Unit of analysis :** One *creature* (character) per row  
- **Plays covered :** ~50–60
- **Characters per play :** 5–15 (up to 20+ in major works)
- **Dataset purpose :** Serve as a pivot between **authors** and **stage personas**, enabling quantitative and qualitative analyses of character, plot, and theatrical archetypes
- **Relational scope :** linked by `Creator_ID`, `Play_ID`, `Character_ID`  

Each creature can thus be traced to its author, play and network of symbolic or emotional relations.

The dataset is designed for both **qualitative interpretation** and **quantitative exploration**.  
A flexible framework adaptable to database, graph, visualization models.
