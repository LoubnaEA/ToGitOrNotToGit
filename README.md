# ToGitOrNotToGit
***That is the commit question !*** 💀

Exploring Death, Taboo and Transgression in Elizabethan & Jacobean Drama, with a dash of Data, QA and Git. 

---

## 🎭 A Prelude to the Dark Stage
Who dies most brutally ? Who betrays, lusts or falls victim to fate’s cruel algorithm ?  
**`ToGitOrNotToGit 💀`** is a **hybrid literary-data laboratory** : part ***digital humanities***, part ***QA-inspired analysis***, part ***literary essay***.      
intellectually rigorous yet playfully transgressive, it dissects how the Elizabethan and Jacobean stage encoded its own fatal bugs. 
Here, revenge is a recursive function ! Lust a corrupted variable ! Death the only assert that never fails, all revealed through the 🕯️of **data, networks and digital storytelling**.

```python
assert hamlet_alive == False, "Hamlet should be dead by Act V" 
assert 'revenge' in macbeth_themes, "Macbeth must contain revenge"  
````

## Conceptual Framework    
= ***What to explore & why*** : the narrative arc in four acts from stage to spreadsheet, from plot points to data points  
#### **Part I - The Shakespearean Death Map**  
Every tragedy is a dataset of human error.  
Deaths, betrayals and suicides are logged like failed test cases :  
`bloodlust`, `revenge`, `betrayal` become binary fields,  
and each play yields its own QA report of moral collapse.  

#### **Part II - The Jacobean & Elizabethan Edge**  
The later stage grows darker,  
as if the moral constraints of Elizabeth’s reign had been versioned into obsolescence.  
Taboos cascade unchecked, violence runs in loops,  
and the dramaturgical system groans under its own excess.  

#### **Part III - Mapping the Taboo**  
A taxonomy of transgression emerges : religion, morality, desire, disease.  
Each entry a node in a *Taboo Atlas*, each dataset a confession.  
Where the Elizabethan script feared divine punishment,  
the Jacobean one debugged guilt itself.  

#### **Part IV - Digital Afterlife**  
From stage to spreadsheet, from verse to version control.  
The lineage of influence flows through branches and merges,  
ghosts of Marlowe haunting Shakespeare’s commits,  
echoes of Ford reappearing in modern adaptations.  
A continuous integration of the macabre.

## Tech & Data Lab 
 = ***How to explore it*** : tools and pipelines to transform texts into datasets, networks, visualizations, QA-checked analyses.  
#### Digital Humanities & Text Analytics  
Named Entity Recognition becomes a resurrection ritual :  
each token a fragment of memory, each entity a ghost tagged for analysis.  
Networks of characters (`NetworkX`, `Neo4j`) reveal webs of betrayal and kinship.  
#### Data Storytelling & Visualization  
Dashboards turn into moral cartographies, 
Plotly timelines of downfall, Folium maps of contagion,  
and dynamic heatmaps that make sin measurable.  
#### QA-Inspired Pipelines  
Automated extraction of deaths, cross-checking transgressions.  
Flaky data mirrors human inconsistency.
